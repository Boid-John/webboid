      h3.text-center(style="padding-top:30px;") Boid Alpha 2 has concluded
      h4.text-center Alpha 3 will launch on September 8th
      p(style="margin-top:50px;") Due to overwhelming demand that has swamped our servers, we decided to pause the Boid leaderboards and accounts system. We are focusing on upgrading the platform to handle more users for Alpha 3. Alpha 3 will feature:
      ul
        li Charity pool leaderboard.
        li Additional Teams.
        li More reliable desktop apps.
        li Increased profitabiltiy.
      div
        h5 If you participated in Alpha 2
        ul
          li Your account information, including wallet balance will transfer over automatically.
          li You will receive a 10% bonus increase to your token balance, and you will be able to redeem your BOID token balance to your EOS account.
          li If you would prefer to withdraw your current balance without the bonus, email us at alpha@boid.com from the address of your registered Boid account.
          li If you are currently running the Boid Desktop app, you can continue to run the app, and your contributions are being tracked, but Boid Power will not display in the UI, and you may be unable to login. Your tracked contributions will count towards your account in Alpha 3.
